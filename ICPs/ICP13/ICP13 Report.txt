**Intro **

The goal of this project is to design a small sensor station and transmit the collected sensor data via WiFi 
to an Android device and webpage simultaneously. We chose to use a sensor for temperature of the area in which the hardware is stored.

**Objectives** 

The objective of this project is to show how MIT App inventor can communicate with webpages and how to use the 
arduino IDE and NodeMCU hardware to create that webpage. 

**Approaches **

Our NodeMCU that we first received seemed to be having some issues connecting so we got a new one. Shortly 
thereafter, we had a hard time finding and downloading the library. It wasn't until we found a link to place in a 
manual repository (in the Arduino IDE: File --> Preferences --> "Additional Boards Manager URLs:"). If you enter in
 a board manager URL (should be found online) then it allows you to go into board/library manager from the IDE and 
get the specs for that specific board. After we got that to work, the programming and wiring was simple.

**Parameters **

NodeMCU Microcontroller
Arduino IDE
Temperature Sensor

**Evaluation and Conclusion** 

In conclusion, this ICP was pretty neat. Our project for this class will probably utilize what we just learned. 
There's a large number of applications for this technology.
