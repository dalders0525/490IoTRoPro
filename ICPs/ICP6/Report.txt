ICP6: Writing to Arduino with Node-Red

Introduction

For this ICP, we created a JavaScript function node that took in a payload and output a signal that lighted up three LEDs like a traffic light.

Objectives

ICP6 deliverable content includes completed code and a video of an Arduino flashing lights like a traffic light.

Approaches/Methods

JavaScript is fairly new to all members of our group but through a conjoined effort, we were able to derive the syntax required. Also, the Arduino required a special program uploaded to it to communicate with Node Red called "Fermata." It can be found on the Arduino IDE by going File>Examples>Fermata>StandardFermata and by uploading that, your board will be able to communicate with Node Red.

The Node Red Code will be available in the Code section of this repository.

After the code was written and three LEDs hooked up, it was a matter of deploying the code and starting the one second delay. After that, the program was autonomous.
