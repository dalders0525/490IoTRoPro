**Introduction**

NAO H25 (V6) is a little, programmable robot that can be made to move, speak, and retrieve information from web 
hosts using api keys. All of which we cover in this ICP

**Objectives**

The objective of ICP 14 is to program the NAO using the Choregraphe software and retrieve weather data and have the robot repeat it back to me.

**Approaches/Methods**

I read through the lesson and downloaded Choregraphe but I was not able to connect to a virtual robot reliably. 
Because I had no way of troubleshooting, I didn't end up finishing this ICP.

**Workflow**

The workflow for the ICP consisted of connecting to the robot and retrieving weather information from the internet. 
To do this, we use an API key from openweathermap.org. I used the additional libraries to handle .json information, 
url traffic, and python. However, I was not able to get the robot to function as intended and the weekend ended up running 
out on me before I could finish.

**Parameters**

NAO Robot
Choregraphe Suite
Python
openweathermap.org

**Evaluation & Conclusion**

The NAO interface proved challenging for me. I took this on alone outside of class due to personal reasons so learning 
it without guidance was difficult. I don't think it even works 100% of the time as half the time it doesn't connect to the 
virtual robot. I've enjoyed every graphical editing tool provided so far in this class, however, and this is no exception.
This ICP is setup for the second NAO lab, so I will have to do more research to make sure I can connect to and operate the 
robot with little interruptions.
